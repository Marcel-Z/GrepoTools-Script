# Script functions
GrepoTools is a script that makes playing Grepolis more fun and easier.

We once started with a grid for the strategic map and the island overview so that navigation was easier.
Today, GrepoTools is a collection of many tools that improve the gameplay of Grepolis. So much so that many players can no longer live without it.
